Ever wanted to draw a picture with transformed mathematical functions? Yeah, me neither.

# Instructions

Click on a function to select it. T puts you into translation mode where the arrow keys move it around. S puts you into scale mode, where up and down scale the function vertically and left and right scale it horizontally. Z puts you into Start mode where you can control where the function starts with left and right. R does the same for the end of the function.

# I want to create my own functions

Too bad, wait until I finish that feature.
